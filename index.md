# Welcome to Oliver Gibbons Programming Portfolio 

In this portfolio you will see some of the projects that were completed by Oliver Gibbons in Skyline's year one programming class. 

## Programming 1 Semester 1 Projects:

### OOP Calculator

Graphics based OOP calculator. 
The calculator was an excelent project to learn mouse detection with objects, as well as also incorporating logic.

### SpaceGame

Grapics based Spacegame.
The space game project was useful for learning how to make an use different classes, as well as incorporating collision detection.

### Screensaver

Graphics based Screensaver.
The screensaver helped me understand how to use loops and boundary controls.

## Programming 1 Semester 2 Projects:

PigLatin Converter.
The pigLatin converter was my first command line code. Learning how to use only logic with less emphasis on graphics was useful for other projects.

Random word generator.
The random word generator was also a command line environment, with an emphasis on logic. In this project, I learned how to use arrays for string values.
