# Welcome to Oliver Gibbons Programming Portfolio 

In this portfolio, you will see some of the projects that were completed by Oliver Gibbons in Skyline's year one programming class. 

I have my computer programming one 820 certifications. 

## Programming 1 Semester 1 Projects:

### OOP Calculator

Graphics-based OOP calculator. 
The calculator was an excellent project to learn mouse detection with objects and incorporate logic.

### SpaceGame

Graphics-based Spacegame.
The space game project was helpful in learning how to make use of different classes, as well as incorporating collision detection.

### Screensaver

Graphics-based Screensaver.
The screensaver helped me understand how to use loops and boundary controls.

## Programming 1 Semester 2 Projects:

PigLatin Converter.
The pigLatin converter was my first command line code. Learning how to use only logic with less emphasis on graphics was useful for other projects.

Random word generator.
The random word generator was also a command line environment, emphasizing logic. In this project, I learned how to use arrays for string values.
